          The first stage of genocide is classification, the act of separating people into “us and them”. Classification
          is a primary method of dividing society and creating a power struggle between groups. It involves the
          identification and labeling of certain groups based on their ethnicity, religion, or nationality. In many
          cases, governments are the ones manipulating citizens to turn against each other. One of the genocides where
          classification is seen was Rwanda. Before the killing began, Belgian colonists made Tutsis seem superior to
          the Hutus. Which made the Hutus scared that things would turn upside down. The Belgians distinguished Hutus
          and Tutsis by their height, nose, and eye size. Nonetheless, genocides are more likely to occur in bipolar
          societies. One way we can prevent that from happening is to promote common identities and use one type of
          language.

          One way perpetrators identify victims during a genocide is with symbols. They can use words or objects to
          identify a person without falsely accusing them. For instance, objects were used in many genocides like the
          Holocaust. The Nazi Regime forced Jews to wear the Star of David to identify them with ease. Also, it helps
          the perpetrators in a later stage when they are preparing to move victims to ghettos/concentration camps.
          Another symbol that Nazis used during the Holocaust was passports. This was important because if a Jewish
          person tried to flee, it would be much harder. There would be guards at the border waiting to see their
          passports and if they were Jewish, it was impossible to leave. However, it is key to know that genocide may
          not always occur if various symbols are worn. They are universally human and anyone could wear them. To
          prevent something like this from happening, protest to get ethnic, religious, racial, and national identities
          removed from ID cards, and passports.

          At this stage, citizens need to consider that genocide is truly occurring. Dehumanization is when a person is
          treated as less than human. They are considered animals and vermin, which defies human rights. It happens when
          one group defies the humanity of another group and sees the world as better off without those people. One
          genocide where people were dehumanized was the Holocaust. Hate propaganda on TV, paper, and radios persuaded
          Jews as filthy humans. However, not many people had access to the media at the time, which made it harder to
          notice how they were treated. It still does not make it right that nobody stepped in, which is why prevention
          measures have to be taken in the future. Providing specific news stations, shows, and papers that are
          specifically meant to spread the word about genocide, would make a difference. If no one speaks out for the
          people who need help, how would a genocide be stopped? It takes one person to spread the truth, and that is
          how we will strive to prevent a horrific event such as this from occurring in the future.

          Genocide is always planned and is usually led by the government. Sometimes this stage is seen before others,
          but it is a crucial factor in these mass killings. Without a leader to create a plan for genocide, everything
          would be unorganized and chaos would erupt. For example, during the Cambodian genocide, the leader Pol Plot
          was very thoughtful in his plans and had his own army. The Khmer Rouge(army) was very harsh and was trained
          very well before the genocide occurred. Pol plot had taught them to think of Muslims, Chinese, and Vietnamese
          as non-pure Cambodian. This meant that the killing was much easier, and they didn’t feel guilty about their
          actions. Also, they covered up their plans during the civil war, so suspicion didn’t arise. To prevent
          governments and crime groups from getting what they want, citizens could turn against them by protesting.
          Also, the UN needs to get involved because of how much power they possess to stop genocide.

          In this stage, extremists drive groups apart and marriage becomes illegal. Basically, they are isolating and
          installing fear into the victims. Perpetrators take out many people in power because those are the ones that
          most likely would stop them from taking over. During the Rwandan genocide, Hutu kids and Tutsi kids were
          isolated into different schools. It was the first time they couldn’t talk to each other, and Hutus were taught
          to hate Tutsis. Since the kids were very young, it made them much more susceptible to believing what
          perpetrators were telling them. But for history to never repeat itself, we have to take action. One way this
          can be done is by reinforcing laws, making sure that everyone is treated equally, and that someone’s rights
          can never be taken away. By doing this, we can make it much harder for the perpetrators and their plans could
          be stopped. </div>

          This is the stage where perpetrators start to execute their plan and physically move people from one place to
          another. Usually, victims are moved to ghettos which are isolated communities, you can think of them as gated
          committees, however, they weren’t allowed to leave, and people weren’t allowed to enter. As time passed, these
          ghettos would shrink and perpetrators would occupy the homes abandoned by the victims. Afterward, they
          displaced people to concentration camps, where starvation and dehydration was a very common method used to
          kill people. Nonetheless, this was one of many ways to isolate people. During the Native American genocide,
          Europeans forcefully invaded Indian territory and kicked them out. The Native people were far less
          technologically advanced and did not stand a chance against the Europeans. The Trail of Tears was a march that
          forced Native Americans to walk 5 thousand miles, causing hundreds of people to die. Even though this
          historical event is a controversy to this day, it doesn’t take away the fact they had the intention of killing
          Native Americans. A prevention method that needs to be made is military intervention. If there are signs of
          ghettos and concentration camps being built, the military should be contacted immediately.
