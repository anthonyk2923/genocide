    <h1>Be an upstander!</h1>
    <p align=center class="upstander-text">
      As an upstander, it is essential to recognize what it takes to stop a genocide. There are many things a citizen
      can do to prevent injustices from happening. It involves speaking up and taking action to promote equality and
      peace. One of the things a person can do is spread word through the media. This can include posting about it on
      social media or recording a video for others to have tape evidence of it. It is a powerful tool that changes
      things for the better and encourages others to take action. To be an upstander you have to do something not
      because it’s heroic but for the reason that anyone else would do the same thing if they were in your shoes. A very
      signification group of upstanders seen in the past was the resistance movement during the Holocaust. They fought
      back against the Nazis in many concentration camps and rescued many Jews. As Jane Springer mentions in her book,
      Genocide, “Holocaust determined that the individuals helping stop the genocide had these characteristics: “a
      strong sense of individuality, self-reliance, a history of standing up for others, and a tendency to see their aid
      as ordinary, and not particularly heroic” (105, Springer). These are just some of what a person needs to possess,
      in general, they only need one of these. Nonetheless, it takes one person to speak up and start a domino effect
      around the world. We urge you to be an upstander in times of injustice, initiate peaceful protests, raise
      awareness, contact relative authorities, and organizations.
