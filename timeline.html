              <p class="mb-0">The Native American genocide was against the Native Americans, the killing was done by
                European Americans and it was one of the longest genocide out there. Columbus wanted to have American
                soil so he took some extreme measures. For example, he kicked people out of their homes and even
                turturred them. Andrew Jackson was a bystander who didn’t do anything to help, and now people are mad
                and want him
                off the twenty dollar bill. This was considered a genocide because there was intent to kill, and kick
                out Native Americans, which are a group. They were also re-educated and they weren’t recognized as
                citizens.

              <p class="text-muted mb-4"><i class="far fa-clock" aria-hidden="true"></i> 1526-21867</p>
              <p class="mb-0"> The Victims of this conflict were the Africans, about 36 to 60 million were involved in
                this conflict and it was done by the Spanish, the Portugues, the French, and the Dutch. So lots of
                people were perpetrators. What happened was, these perpetrators extracted people from Africa and sold
                them as slaves to Americans. In this issue, the victims weren’t considered full humans, but ⅗ of a human
                and that is dehumanization. This ⅗ rule came out of the constitution and it was a compromise which
                legalized slavery, in the original constitution, anyone who didn’t have freedom was considered ⅗ a
                person which also means that only 3 out of 5 slaves were counted toward the state's population.
                Intrestingly, the Slave Trade was not considered a genocide because there wasn’t intent to kill, more
                intent to enslave and in some cases torture.</p>

              <p class="text-muted mb-4"><i class="far fa-clock" aria-hidden="true"></i> 1915-1917</p>
              <p class="mb-0">The committee of union and progress, and Turkish government feared that Christian
                Armenains wanted to form a rebellion and so, Young Turks, a group of armed Turkens, overthrew the
                Sultan(Many Armenians lived here), this happened in 1908. They tried to fight back but they couldn’t.
                Then in 1915, 600 important political people with lots of power were extracted from their homes and
                taken to be shot and killed. Armenian men had been unarmed and forced to work. If they weren’t killed
                from overwork, they were deported to other countries, and separated from their families. Women and
                children were forced out of their homes and they had to walk for weeks with little to no food. This
                should be considered genocide because many people died, the perpetrators had intent, and many if not all
                the stages of genocide have been mentioned in our research and it should be remembered. </p>

              <p class="mb-0">Peasants along with their families and communist Ukrainians were slowly starved from a
                man-made famine by a man named Joseph Stalin. While all of this was going on, the world did nothing,
                they just let this happen. During this famine, things got so bad for the victims that cannibalism was
                made into a normal occurrence. Imagine fighting somebody for the privilege to eat them. Should it be
                considered a genocide? Yes, it should because the perpetrators had intent to kill and the famine meets
                the United Nations definition of genocide.</p>

              <p class="mb-0">German Nazis attempted to kill all the Jewish people in their nation as well as
                neighboring countries such as Poland. They would begin by shrinking the allowed spaces of Jewish
                villages, first they cut the village in half, and people in the half that was being cut would have to go
                into the other half. And again and again until eventually they took the Jews to death camps where they
                were overworked, starved, or simply taken to gas chambers where poison gas would take their lives. This
                should definitely be considered a genocide and it is the most recognized one yet. It meets all the
                criteria from the UN and over six million people died until finally, Hitler was stopped.</p>
